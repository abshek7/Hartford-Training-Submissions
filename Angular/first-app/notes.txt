Components are the foundational building blocks for any Angular application. Each component has three parts:

TypeScript class
HTML template
CSS styles

Creating component:by default we have app component

before angular 19 ,we where having a standalone parameter in ts file 
from 19 ,all components are by default standalone

@component decorator :It tells angular about extra information about the class
// selector is unique for every component,we use this as tag to render
// imports:modules needed
// styleUrl:CSS file
// templateUrl:a template is the HTML view of a component.
Displays data from the component
Responds to user actions (clicks, input, etc.)
Uses Angular-specific syntax to make the UI dynamic
Component = logic (TypeScript)
Template = view (HTML)


app comp is parent component
How do we render component:By using its selector
if we have to use one component into another component,first we need to import it
if we want to use admin component in app component ,we have to import it into app component-this is done using class name

How to create single file component: component has atleast 3 files .css,.ts,.html
can be written into 1 file
instead of templateUrl we need to use template property ,
we can write html their inside ts file
