FOR LOOP:

A for loop is a count-controlled loop.
You use it when you know in advance how many times the loop should run.
In a for loop, all variables declared in the initialization section must be declared AND initialized there

Syntax
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement)
{
    // code to execute
}

Execution Flow

Initialization runs once

Condition is checked

Code executes if condition is true

Increment/decrement happens

Condition checked again

What for Loop Gives Access To:
Loop counter
Index position
Full control over increment/decrement



int j;

for (int i = 0, j = 5; i < j; i++)
{
 Console.WriteLine(i);
   }

not allowed :All variables in the initialization section must be declared there

OR already exist before the loop



WHILE LOOP:
A while loop is a condition-controlled loop.
It runs as long as a condition remains true.

Syntax
while (condition)
{
    // code
}

Important Point
Condition is checked before executing the loop body.

Best Use Cases

When number of iterations is unknown

User input validation

Reading data until condition fails


Fixed number of repetitions (use for)

When you forget to update condition → infinite loop risk


What while Loop Gives Access To
Conditional repetition
External control variable
No automatic counter


DO-WHILE LOOP:
A do-while loop executes at least once, even if the condition is false.
do
{
    // code
}
while (condition);

usecase:
Menus
At least one execution required
User confirmation loops


FOR-EACH LOOP:
foreach is used to iterate through collections (arrays, lists).

Syntax:
foreach (type variable in collection)
{
    // code
}


Best Use Cases:
Reading collections
No index needed

What NOT to Use It For:
Modifying collection size
Needing index position
Skipping elements by index

What foreach Gives Access To:
Element values
No index
No modification of structure


Limitations of the foreach Loop
1. Non-Index Access: Unlike the for loop, the foreach loop doesn't provide an index variable
that you can use to reference the position of the current element in the collection.

foreach (int num in numbers) 

{ 
 if (num == target) 
 { return ???;   // do not know the index of num
 }
}


2. Collection Modification: cannot remove or add elements to the collection while iterating with a foreach loop.

foreach(int num in marks) 

{   // cannot modify array or collections like list and set.

    // only changes num not

    // the element

    num = num * 2; 

}

3. Foreach only iterates forward over the array in single steps

// cannot be converted to a foreach loop

for (int i = numbers.Length - 1; i > 0; i--) 

{

     Console.WriteLine(numbers[i]);

}

4. Performance Overhead: This may have performance drawbacks compared to traditional loops, especially with large datasets.
