so give me a ideal folder directory for   aspnet core web api application with all files and folder and tell me why each are needed

Method	Endpoint	Description	             Request Body	Response Body
GET	/api/rooms	Get all hostel rooms	     None	        Array of room objects

DELETE	/api/rooms/{id}	Delete a room	None	     None               (204 No Content)


component class
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

Data Annotation -Model Design
-- Required
-- MinLength
-- Range


DTO:
These are not entity models



Services:
Create interface and Classes
common place to register


program.cs
dependency injection
construction
AddScoped


AddTransient (new instance every time) 
or AddSingleton (one instance for app lifetime), 
AddScoped provides a balance for web applications.
by default aspnet used DI


Like inject:
    private readonly IProductService _productService;
        public ProductsController(IProductService productService)
        {
            _productService = productService;
        }


lifetime deciding
service oriented registration
services should definitely do dependency injection




Service-interface register and peform crud

Product Class-
product
dtos
models
service
controller
