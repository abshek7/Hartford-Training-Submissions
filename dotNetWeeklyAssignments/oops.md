*If you do NOT write any constructor, C# automatically creates a default constructor for you.*



*If you write at least one constructor, C# does NOT create the default one.*



*You can have multiple constructors, but the compiler-generated default constructor and your own constructor cannot exist at the same time.*



*Initialization and for poco:*

*fields and properties*

*zero arguments constructor*

*parameterized constructors*

*ToString() override*

*methods but no business logics*
