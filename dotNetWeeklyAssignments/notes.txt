Debugging is the process of finding, analyzing, and fixing errors (bugs) 
in a program by running it step-by-step and observing its behavior.
 
1. START DEBUGGING
Key: F5

Description:
- Compiles and runs the program with the debugger attached.
- Breakpoints become active.
- Program execution pauses at breakpoints.
- Allows step-by-step execution and variable inspection.

Use Case:
- When you want to analyze program flow
- When fixing logical or runtime errors

 
2. START WITHOUT DEBUGGING 
Key: Ctrl + F5

Description:
- Runs the program normally without attaching the debugger.
- Breakpoints are ignored.
- Faster execution.

Use Case:
- When code is already tested
- To see only the final output

Important Note:
- Breakpoints DO NOT work with Ctrl + F5. 

3. STOP DEBUGGING 
Key: Shift + F5

Description:
- Immediately stops the running program.
- Ends the current debugging session.

Use Case:
- When debugging is no longer required
- When program is stuck or running infinitely
 
4. BREAKPOINT 
Key: F9

Description:
- A breakpoint pauses program execution at a specific line.
- Execution stops BEFORE that line runs.
- Represented by a red dot in the margin.

Use Case:
- To inspect variable values
- To understand program behavior
- To locate logical errors
 
5. STEP OVER 
Key: F10

Description:
- Executes the current line.
- If the line contains a function call, the function runs completely.
- Control moves to the next line without entering the function.

Use Case:
- When the function is trusted
- To move quickly through code
 
6. STEP INTO 
Key: F11

Description:
- Executes the current line.
- If the line contains a function call, debugger enters the function.
- Allows line-by-line execution inside the function.

Use Case:
- When debugging function logic
- To inspect parameters and internal calculations
 
7. STEP OUT 
Key: Shift + F11

Description:
- Completes execution of the current function.
- Returns control to the calling function.
- Skips remaining lines in the current function.

Use Case:
- When you are done debugging inside a function
 
8. CONTINUE EXECUTION 
Key: F5 (while debugging)

Description:
- Resumes program execution from the current breakpoint.
- Stops again if another breakpoint is encountered.

Use Case:
- To jump to the next breakpoint
 
9. RESTART DEBUGGING 
Key: Ctrl + Shift + F5

Description:
- Stops the current debugging session.
- Restarts the program from the beginning with debugger attached.

Use Case:
- After code changes
- To debug from the start again
 
10. WATCH WINDOW 
Key: Ctrl + Alt + W, then press 1

Description:
- Allows tracking specific variables or expressions.
- Updates values as execution progresses.

Use Case:
- Monitoring important variables continuously
 
11. CALL STACK 
Key: Ctrl + Alt + C

Description:
- Shows the list of active function calls.
- Displays the order in which functions were called.

Use Case:
- Understanding program flow
- Debugging nested method calls
 
12. CONDITIONAL BREAKPOINT 
Key: No default key (Right-click breakpoint)

Description:
- Breakpoint that triggers only when a condition is true.
- Example: i == 5 or sum > 100

Use Case:
- Debugging large loops
- Avoid stopping on every iteration
 
13. DEBUG MODE vs RELEASE MODE 
Key:
- Debug Mode: Default
- Release Mode: Change from toolbar

Description:
- Debug Mode: Enables debugging, symbols, and breakpoints.
- Release Mode: Optimized, faster, debugging disabled.

Use Case:
- Debug Mode for testing
- Release Mode for final deployment
