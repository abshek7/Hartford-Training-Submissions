Entity Framework:

ORM -- Make database operations with ease

https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/

Approaches:
Have Db or not
Code-First
DB-First
Before and After 6th version
Prior .net 3.5 they used to ADO.NET code

Connection String: Setup the connection for hashing and caching

Uses Models and Generates Classes
Use  Table and Generate POCO

It provides automation for writing crud operations and generating pocos

Mapping: Build Entity Data model

Mostly code first approach :from code we get db

Querying:
EF API translates LINQ-to-Entities queries to SQL queries for relational databases using EDM and also converts results back to entity objects.

Saving
EF API infers INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands based on the state of entities when the SaveChanges() method is called. The ChangeTracker keeps track of the states of each entity as and when an action is performed.


DbSet--- represents reference to table
